COMPREHENSIVE 12-YEAR BACKTESTING RESULTS (2014-2025)
============================================================

STRATEGY DESCRIPTION:
--------------------
We are using Adj Closes that are 30% below the 50-day MA to create buy signals, and sell signals are created when 50-day MA crossovers occur, more than 30 days have elapsed, or we reach the end of the year.

PROMPT USED TO CREATE CODE:
-------------------------
I have S&P500 stock data for 25 years in csv files in a directory called "YahooStockData"; the files contain the following columns: Date, Close, Adj Close, High, Low, Open, Volume, Ticker. Process all stocks in the directory. Set a variable called theYear to 2024.
For each trading day in theYear, check if:
- the adjusted close is at least 30% below the 50-day moving average on that trading day.
If a stock meets these criteria, create a buy signal for that trading day.
Create a sell signal when any one of these conditions is met on a later trading day:
- the adjusted close is above the 50-day moving average on that trading day.
- more than 30 trading days have elapsed since the buy signal was created for this stock.
- we reach the end of theYear.
